The Nazi Flag. Used during Adolph Hitler's Reign. <br>
Nowadays, the flag has been readopted by the Neo- <br>Nazis.
</p2>
<p3 id = "paragraph-3">
In our current age, rascism and hate speech are condemned. Many<br> hate groups
groups practice activities that promote rascism in secret.<br> However, under the
presidency of Donald Trump these groups, <br>including the Neo Nazis, have begun
to take their message to the <br>public. There is great debate on whether or not  such groups should be<br> allowed.
One one side many believe in the right to free speech and <br>assembly, but many others
find their message to contain both hate <br>speech and believe that the groups  are a form of terrorism.

  Thesis: The Nazis, condemned by nations all around <br>the world, are beginning to resurface under the new<br>name of Neo-Nazis. Their message and goals to <br>create a "superior" race were never accepted in the<br>past, and definitely should not be accepted today.
